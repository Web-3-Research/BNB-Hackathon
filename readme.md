Technical Overview
This dApp will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, as it is the most widely used and secure platform for decentralized applications. The dApp will utilize smart contracts as the backbone for the portfolio management functionality.

Architecture
The dApp will have three main components:

The user interface (UI): This will be the frontend of the dApp, where users can connect their wallets, deposit funds, select leader accounts to follow, and perform other actions. The UI can be built using modern web development technologies such as React.js or Angular.js.

The smart contract: This will be the backbone of the dApp and will be responsible for executing all the portfolio management functionality. The smart contract will have functions for deposit, follow, and withdraw. The smart contract will be written in Solidity, the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The leader account: This will be an account that the depositor can follow. The leader account will contain a set of instructions for the follower account to follow. The leader account can be created by anyone and can contain arbitrary instructions.

Functionality
Deposit: The user will connect their wallet to the dApp and use the deposit function to deposit funds into a contract that creates a follower account owned by the user's wallet. The depositor can deposit any tradeable token.

Follow: The depositor can select a leader account to follow with the follower account. The follower account will follow the instructions in the leader account, which can be an arbitrary number of different kinds of tokens.

Withdraw: The user that owns the follower account can withdraw the tokens at any time. One user can have many follower accounts, and those follower accounts can only be withdrawn and acted upon by the original owner.

Portfolio Management: The long-term goal of this dApp is to allow for users to have a portfolio management tool that can take any kind of instructions and perform any kind of on-chain action.

Security Considerations
Security is a top priority for this dApp. To ensure the security of the funds, the smart contract code will be thoroughly audited by reputable security firms before deployment. Additionally, the dApp will follow best practices for smart contract development, such as using the latest version of the Solidity compiler and following the Ethereum security guidelines.

Modularity
The dApp will be designed to be as modular as possible, so the leader instructions can be automated or something arbitrary like if someone tweets, buy bitcoin. The instructions in the leader account will be stored as a set of rules in a specific format, which can be easily parsed and executed by the follower account.
